# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CraftConnect is an AI-powered eco-impact marketplace that empowers artisans by showcasing sustainable crafts with fair pricing, auto-tagging, and eco-impact insights.

## Development Status

This repository is currently in its initial setup phase. The project structure and development commands will be established as the codebase grows.

## Anticipated Architecture Components

Based on the project description, future development will likely involve:

- **Marketplace Frontend**: User interface for browsing and purchasing sustainable crafts
- **Artisan Portal**: Interface for artisans to manage their products and view analytics
- **AI Auto-tagging System**: Machine learning components for categorizing and tagging products
- **Eco-impact Analytics**: System for calculating and displaying environmental impact metrics
- **Fair Pricing Engine**: Algorithm for ensuring equitable pricing for artisans
- **Backend API**: RESTful or GraphQL API to support marketplace operations
- **Database Layer**: Storage for products, users, transactions, and analytics

## Development Guidelines

When implementing this project, consider:

- Implementing sustainable development practices that align with the eco-friendly mission
- Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in the user interface design
- Building scalable AI/ML pipelines for product categorization and impact analysis
- Creating robust analytics systems for tracking environmental impact metrics
- Developing secure payment processing for fair artisan compensation
- Implementing multi-language support for global artisan participation

## Getting Started

As this is a new project, initial setup commands will be added here once the technology stack is chosen and the project structure is established.

## Notes for Future Development

- Technology stack decisions should prioritize sustainability and ethical considerations
- Consider green hosting solutions and energy-efficient architectures
- Implement comprehensive testing for AI/ML components
- Ensure GDPR compliance and data privacy for global users
- Plan for mobile-responsive design to reach artisans in various regions
